# Maralria-detection
Detection of malaria using CNN

1)The notebook was created in google colab.

2)Recommended to open the notebook in google colab so all the path settings dont get messed up.

3)The dataset https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria/downloads/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria.zip/1 link.

4)If you want to just directly run the notebook go to kaggle download your own api token  which downloads in form of kaggle.json and in line no 11 upload the kaggle.json and you are good to go.Else you have to make apth settings yourself.
